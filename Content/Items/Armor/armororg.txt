ARMOR FILE ORGANIZATION
====

A short guide.

-----

Armor is organized based on what class the armor belongs to.

For example, a class item pertaining to a Titan will always appear within the "Titan" folder.

However, since all armor pertains normally to a "set", there is only one file per SET of armor.

This means each piece of an armor set is contained within a central file, with its assets being pulled from the Assets folder.

For ex.

=> armor_vaultofglass_titan => the main set of Vault of Glass for Titans
	|
	|====> armor_vaultofglass_titan_helmet => "Kabr's Battlecage"
			|
			|====> grab sprite(s) w/ "{name}_sheet#"
			|====> set relevant data (is Helment, is Legendary, earnable from Vault of Glass, added in vanilla (or S14))

	|====> armor_vaultofglass_titan_arms => "Kabr's Brazen Grips"
	|====> armor_vaultofglass_titan_chest => "Kabr's Wrath"
	|====> armor_vaultofglass_titan_legs => "Kabr's Forceful Greaves"
	|====> armor_vaultofglass_titan_class => idk whatever it's called.
	|====> armor_vaultofglass_titan_playerLink => other data / relevant info regarding the set as a whole.
